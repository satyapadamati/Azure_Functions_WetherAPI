# Weather API with Azure Functions

This project demonstrates how to build a serverless **Weather API** using **Azure Functions**. The API fetches real-time weather data from an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and returns it in a simple, accessible format.

## Features

- **Serverless architecture** using Azure Functions
- **Real-time weather data** from a reliable weather API
- Scalable and cost-efficient deployment with **Azure Functions** and **GitHub Actions**

## Tech Stack

- **Azure Functions** (for serverless computing)
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (for weather data)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (for API logic)
- **GitHub Actions** (for continuous deployment)

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure** account (for deploying Azure Functions)
- A **GitHub** account (for version control and deployment automation)
- An **OpenWeatherMap API key** (for fetching weather data)
  
  You can get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-api-azure-functions.git
